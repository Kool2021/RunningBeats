As a distance runner that likes to listen to music, a problem I commonly face is coming up with a playlist for my runs. This web app solves that problem by generating the perfect playlist for every run based on certain preferences. It caters to the user's running pace, cadence, and preferred music genres to generate a Spotify playlist. 

The way it works is simple. The user selects their target pace, their typical strides per minute (SPM), and some of their favorite genres to listen to while running. The web app then interacts with Spotify's API to match the user's preferences to existing songs. Once those songs are selected, the web app proceeds to the next page and displays those results. The user is even able to directly save that playlist to their own Spotify account with a simple click of a button without having to manually add each song to their own playlist. I really enjoyed making this app and definitely plan to use it on my own runs in the future.
